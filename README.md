Greedy Implementation of Coin Changing Problem

Language Used - C

Suppose that the available coins are in the denominations that are powers of c, i.e., the denominations are c0, c1, …, ck for some integers c > 1 and k ≥ 1. Show that the greedy algorithm always yields an optimal solution. 

Give a set of coin denominations for which the greedy algorithm does not yield an optimal solution. Your set should include a penny so that there is a solution for every value of n.
